Run this code on https://www.overleaf.com/project because running it on VSCode is a bit challenging.

To run it on VSCode, you would need to install MiKTeX and Strawberry Perl. However, there are issues with Strawberry Perl: 
- There is no community support.
- The last version released was 5.82.2, and there have been no further updates.
- MiKTeX does not support this version of Strawberry Perl.

Use the code on Overleaf to create a resume based on your needs.
